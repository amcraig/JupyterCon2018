>An overview of the interactive widget ecosystem available in the Jupyter notebook, including ipywidgets and bqplot, and illustrates how Jupyter widgets can be used to build rich visualizations of machine learning models. Along the way, Chakri walks you through algorithms like regression, clustering, and optimization and shares a wizard for building and training deep learning models with diagnostic plots.

## Introduction
* ipywidgets: core UI controls
* bqplotL 2D plotting widgets
    * acts like Matplotlib i.e. import bqplot.pyplot as plt
## Overview of Interactive Widgets

## Example 

## ML Algorithms/Models
### Kernel Regression
"Local Regression" Non-parametric way for computing E[X|Y]
* the lower the Kernel Band Width -> 0 makes an almost exact fit curve, like Dirac Function
* ->10(or so) becomes a uniform distribution

### K-Means


### PCA vs Autoencoder
* PCA - Linear (only does well with well behaved datasets)
* AE - can be more than 1D so can fit more complicated datasets
  

### Tools for deep learning
