# How JupyterLab and widgets enable interactive analysis of the Earth's past, present, and future

Tyler Erickson: Google (He's a Snow Hydrologist)

>The Earth is rapidly changing, and this change has numerous important environmental and societal impacts. There is a strong need to understand these changes at a global scale in high resolution so that we might reverse or adapt to them.

Colaboratory - Free Hosted Jupyter Notebook Environment

Tyler helps NGOs and groups around the world to approach geospatial data science for humanitarian reasons

Topics include:

* Trends in adoption of Jupyter technologies at Earth science conferences data and by Earth science data and information providers
* How to combine multiple Jupyter widgets in JupyterLab to interactively explore and analyze high-dimensional data stored on remote platforms
* Case studies of using Jupyter widgets for Earth science data analysis, such as analyzing land-cover change models and exploring projections of future climate conditions

While the case studies will use Googleâ€™s Earth Engine platform, the techniques demonstrated are applicable to most remote geospatial platforms that provide API access.

## Spatial is Special - Geospatial Data Quirks
e.g. lat, lon, pressure, creation time, forcast time, model forcing parameters

Distance/proximity is important "Cant See it, look around it"

The data is NOT static at all

Landsat - satellite ~450 GB per scene, one scene per 45 seconds for around the last 40 years

1970 - $15
1980 - $6000
1990 - $600
2009 - free - Creation of Earth Engine

Landset scenes are **messy**, a lot of post processing by NASA is required to polish it up

## Earth Engine

it is a web api for a lot of geospacial datasets

* \>10 Petabytes large
* \>200 public datasets
* \>5000 new images a day
* \>5 million images

Javascript and Python api
