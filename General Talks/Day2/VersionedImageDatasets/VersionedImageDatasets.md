>Reproducible data is essential for notebooks that work across time, across contributors, and across machines. Jackson Brown and Aneesh Karve demonstrate how to use an open source data registry to create reproducible data dependencies for Jupyter and share a case study in open science over terabyte-size image datasets.

Open science should expose the entire pipeline
