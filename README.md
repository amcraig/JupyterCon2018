# JupyterCon2018
Notes and example files from my trip to JupyterCon 2018
***
All notes should be in Markdown and most should contain a link to the slides and presenter's Github/lab for supplimentary notebooks and files. I tried to include notebooks and files for the ones I could access and should be in the same directory as the notes.

Some notes are within directories that include notebooks and data.
