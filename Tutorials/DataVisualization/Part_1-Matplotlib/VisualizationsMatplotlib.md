# Data Visualizations with Matplotlib

Pie (and some 3D) Plots are bad because humans are bad at comparing angles

Humans have poor perception, and likes to fill in the gaps for an easy answer i.e. opposing arrows demonstration (optical illusions)

Use color schemes:
* Complementary (Split complementary [2 analogous colors: one complementary to the two])
* Rectangle
* Analogous

Culture also has a significant impact on the perception of color.

10% of all people have color blindness

Many tools have made designed to design palettes:
* [iwanthue](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/)
* [colorotate](http://web.colorotate.org/)
* [Colourlovers](https://www.colourlovers.com/)

Good book: Fundamental Principles of Analytical Design
1. Show comparisons, contrasts, and differences
2. Show Causality, mechanism, explaination and systematic structure
3. Show multivariate data 
4. Completely integrate words numbers, images, and diagrams
5. Documantation
6. Content maters most of all

**Rules can be broken**

The fundamental tools we can use:
* Points
* Lines
* Areas
* Shapes
* Colors
* Text

Examples of effective plots 
* Scatter plot - points/lines
* Bar chart - Area and colors
* Bubble chart - Scatter chart + area and color representing 4 Dimentional data
* Pie chart - Area and colors

**Remember** Images are only 3-Dimensional arrays! (x, y, color
